          <h3>My passion for web development</h3>
          <p>I used to dabble with the "inspect" tool on Google Chrome as a teenager and amuse myself with the small changes I could make.
          I started working with platforms such as Joomla and Wordpress in college using various themes and tools. However, using these,
          I found myself needing and wanting more out of the premade tools than was available. I eventually enrolled in Thinkful's Engineering Flex programming
          and realized I had a lot to learn. Since beginning the program, I have learned so much, and subsequently yearn to learn more. The feeling of creating
          and functioning, responsive, and visually-appealing product is unmatched.</p>

           would be beneficial for my own progress as a developer and to the team for my skills that I can provide</p>
